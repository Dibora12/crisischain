 
# 🌍 CrisisChain – Blockchain Powered Aid Distribution For Africa

**CrisisChain** is a decentralized web application platform designed to bring **transparency, fairness, and security** to humanitarian aid distribution across Africa. Built on the privacy focused **Midnight blockchain**, it enables NGOs, donors, governments, and communities to collaborate in a **trustless, verifiable ecosystem** where aid flows directly to verified recipients with no corruption or mismanagement.

---

## ✨ Purpose

Too often, aid gets lost before reaching the people who need it most. CrisisChain solves this by using blockchain to:

- Securely verify identities
- Track every step of aid distribution
- Issue tamper-proof digital aid tokens
- Enable real-time dashboards for transparency

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Blockchain-based aid tracking** using Midnight smart contracts
- 🎟️ **Token-based aid claiming** via verified digital identity
- 🧾 **Zero-knowledge verification** to protect user privacy
- 📊 **Admin dashboard** with real-time analytics
- 📍 **Map-based tracking** of aid distribution centers
- 👛 **Lace Wallet integration** for secure transactions
- 🛡️ **Tamper-proof, fraud-resistant system**
